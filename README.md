# Time-Series-Analyzing-And--Forcasting-Methods

# Introduction
Across industries, organizations commonly use time series data, which means any information collected over a regular interval of time, in their operations. Examples include daily stock prices, energy consumption rates, social media engagement metrics and retail demand, among others. Analyze time series data yields insights like trends, seasonal patterns and forecasts into future events that can help generate profits. For example, by understanding the seasonal trends in demand for retail products, companies can plan promotions to maximize sales throughout the year.

# the Different Components of Time Series Analysis

1.	`Trend:` The Trend shows the variation of data with time or the frequency of data. Using a Trend, you can see how your data increases or decreases over time. The data can increase, decrease, or remain stable. Over time, population, stock market fluctuations, and production in a company are all examples of trends.

2.	`Seasonality:` Seasonality is used to find the variations which occur at regular intervals of time. Examples are festivals, conventions, seasons, etc. These variations usually happen around the same time period and affect the data in specific ways which you can predict. 

3.	`Irregularity:` Fluctuations in the time series data do not correspond to the trend or seasonality. These variations in your time series are purely random and usually caused by unforeseeable circumstances, such as a sudden decrease in population because of a natural calamity.

4.	`Cyclic:` Oscillations in time series which last for more than a year are called cyclic. They may or may not be periodic.

5.	`Stationary:` A time series that has the same statistical properties over time is stationary. The properties remain the same anywhere in the series. Your data needs to be stationary to perform time-series analysis on it. A stationary series has a constant mean, variance, and covariance.
